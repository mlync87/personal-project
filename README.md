# personal-project
A full stack to do application. 
In this personal project a user can:

* create and add items to a list

* set order of tasks by urgency
* delete tasks

* check off tasks as complete/incomplete

* store task items using mongoDb

To make this application I have used the
MERN stack. This includes:

* mongoDB 

* expressJS 

* React

* nodeJS
